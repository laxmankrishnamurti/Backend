# Chapter-02 (Server concept with Node)

- Assignment 01: Capture the request which goes when you like a post on Instagram (using Chrome network). What are the headers ? What is the payload ?

- Assignment 02: Try and run 2 different server using the same code you have index.js. You will need to use 2 different ports. But can you do it using the same file and changing PORTS dynamically somehow ?
