Mongoose is an "ODM(Object data modeling)" library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to model application data, define schemas with data validation, perform CRUD Operations, and manage relationship between data.

Having a foundational understanding of MongoDB will enable us to better design schemas, perform efficient queries, manage indexes, and troubleshoot issues that may arise when working with Mongoose.
