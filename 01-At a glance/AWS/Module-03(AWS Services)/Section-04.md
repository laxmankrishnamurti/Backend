# IAM User

<code>Select IAM service -> Users -> Create User</code>

User can be a part of a group. Instead of creating multiple users and assigning it for a particular access to a service we can create a group and apply all the rules or the boundation rules on the group that will automatically apply on the all users that is a part of the group.

<code>Define all permissions -> Add Groups -> Add Policies(single/multile) -> Create User -> Sign in -> Change IAM password</code>

- Enable MFA(Multi-factor authentication)
- Add permissions
- Add boundries
- Remove Boundries
- Account Settings
- ...........etc
