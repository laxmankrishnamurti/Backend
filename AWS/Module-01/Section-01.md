# Introduction to Cloud Computing.

Let's first understand how we deploy an application so that it can available to the end user. What we do when our application is ready to host basically we buy multiple servers and do lots of networking stuffs and there are lots of work in the deployment phase so we need lots of computation power and for managing all those stuffs we also need man-power they can manage it. It tipical looks like good but if we see it as a business purspective it dosen't help a lot to save money.

It requires more money to run an application and make it available to the end user. And as a developer perspective if the application is so big like the application receives millions of request per day it get more harder to manage it. Basically the prolems that we face without clod computing are follows :-

- Require more capital
- Need more workforce
- Harder to manage it
- Scalability issues
- Performance issues

Here comes Cloud Computing that resolve most of the problems that we are facing to run an application.

# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of

- Compute
- DB
- Storage
- Applications
- ......Variour IT services

through out cloud services platform where pay as you grow model is implemented. It means if we use less resources it means we have to pay less amount and if our application uses more resources of the cloud network it means we have to pay as much amount as we have used the resources.

To be more precise it is like we re renting computers from a cloud providers. At the end of the day what cloud provider provies us is just some computer resources like CPUs, GPUs, RAM, ROM, Firewall, Security, 24\*7 hours electricity.....etc.

Cloud Provider itself says -> We do all the heavy lifting.

### Advantages

- Lower variable cost
- Easy to deploy
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to scale
- High availability
- High Performance
