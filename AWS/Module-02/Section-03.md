# Getting started with AWS

## AWS Management Console

A place from where we can manage all AWS services.

Browser based GUI to manage all AWS services.

For security purpose, a login session will expire in 12 hours when we sign in into the AWS management console with our AWS or IAM account credentials.

If we will use the resources and services that are not part of free Tier account we will be charged for that.

## How to sign up for a Free AWS Account

[Go to AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

Follow the steps and complete all stuffs. This is a five-step process which is simple and easy process. Once the account has been created Sign in into the account.

As of now, Sign In as a Root User like an Admin account which has full access of the account and we can create multiple users which has limited permission to the aws account.

It is highly recommended to enable multi-factor authentication for root user to prevent the aws account so that no one can access the aws account.

There is an AWS-Service named "Security, Identity & Compliance" that offeres a service which is "IAM" used to create multile users and we can limit the amount of accesses of any particular service of aws to each user.

#### AAA :- Authentication(who are you), Authorization(Do you have permission to do that), Accounting(store log alogn with the user that has been the changed the configuration) (To manage server infrastructure -> To manage user database and integrate it with the server.) -> This exist before Cloud to manage AAA server.

Like AAA server, IAM AWS-service is used for.
